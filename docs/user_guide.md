ðŸš€ Getting Started

Step 1: Clone the Repository

git clone https://github.com/your-username/linux-driver-eval
cd linux-driver-eval

Step 2: Install Requirements

pip install -r requirements.txt

Step 3: Set Up .env

Create a file named .env:

GROQ_API_KEY=your_real_groq_key_here

Step 4: Generate Driver Code from Prompts

python scripts/generate_drivers_groq.py

This reads from prompts/sample_prompts.json and creates .c files in generated_code/

Step 5: Evaluate Drivers

python scripts/run_evaluation.py

Evaluated scores will appear in the results/ folder.

Output Structure

generated_code/ â€“ Contains .c files generated by Groq

results/ â€“ Contains .json files with evaluation scores

 Optional

You can add your own prompts in the JSON file, or extend the evaluation logic inside the evaluation_engine/ folder.
